## What is Covid-game??

Covid-game, a.k.a 'Run Boris, Run!', is a game developed to pass the time in quarantine whilst also practising your social distancing skills (virtually of course!).

## Instructions
Welcome to "our game".

Covid has struck the world. You must now adapt to survive.

Mrs. Morris is in desperate need of milk, but she can not leave her home as she is old and at risk of infection.
You are her only hope of having a cuppa.

Are you up for the challenge?

You must not come within 2 meters of anyone or you will be at risk yourself.

If you stay too close for too long you will get sick and be placed in quarantine.
